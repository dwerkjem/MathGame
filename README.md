# Simple Math Game

This is a simple math game that I created to help me practice my math skills. The game is a simple command line game that asks the user to solve a math problem. The user is given a score based on how many problems they solve correctly and how quickly they solve them. The game is written in Python and uses the `random` module to generate random math problems.

## Installation

To install the game, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)

Once you have Python installed, you can download the game files from this repository. You can either clone the repository using Git, or download the files as a ZIP archive.

To clone the repository using Git, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dwerkjem/MathGame.git

cd MathGame
```

Next you will need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install poetry

poetry install
```

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command in your terminal:
